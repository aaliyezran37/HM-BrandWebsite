    <h2> 1947 </h2>
    <p>
        Our founder, Erling Persson, explored many ideas before finding the inspiration to open his first clothing store in 1947. At a time when fashion was out of reach for many, he envisioned a store where women could find stylish and affordable clothing. He named the store ‚ÄòHennes,‚Äô which means ‚ÄòHers‚Äô in Swedish, reflecting his commitment to making fashion accessible for everyone.
